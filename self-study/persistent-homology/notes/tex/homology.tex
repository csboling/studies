\begin{defn}[Homotopy, homotopy type]
Let $X, Y$ be topological spaces, and let $f : X \to Y$ and
$g : X \to Y$. A \emph{homotopy} is a continuous function
$h : [0,1] \to (X \to Y)$ such that $h(0) = f$ and $h(1) = g$.

Two functions $f : X \to Y$ and $g : Y \to X$ are said to be
\emph{homotopy equivalent} or to possess the same \emph{homotopy type}
if $f \circ g$ is homotopic to $\mathrm{id}_Y$ and $g \circ f$ is
homotopic to
$\mathrm{id}_X$.
\end{defn}

\begin{defn}[Simplicial complex]
A finite set $K$ of simplices is called a \emph{simplicial complex} if
\begin{enumerate}
  \item{if $\sigma \in K$ and $\tau \leq \sigma$ then
        $\tau \in K$,}
  \item{for $\sigma, \tau \in K$, either $\sigma \cap \tau =
      \varnothing$ or $\sigma \cap \tau \leq \sigma$ and $\sigma \cap
      \tau \leq \tau$.
       }
\end{enumerate}
\end{defn}

\begin{defn}[Polyhedron, triangulable space]
The \emph{polyhedron} of a simplicial complex $K$ is the union of all
simplices in the complex, denoted $|K|$.

A topological space $X$ is
said to be \emph{triangulable} if there exists a simplicial complex
$K$ and a homeomorphism $f : |K| \to X$, in which case the pair
$(K, f)$ is called a \emph{triangulation} of $X$.
\end{defn}

\begin{defn}[Oriented simplex, $r$-chain group]
An \emph{oriented $r$-simplex} is an $r$-cycle in the symmetric group
over the $0$-skeleton of a simplicial complex $K$. The
\emph{$r$-chain group} $C_r(K)$ of a simplicial complex is a free
abelian group generated by the oriented $r$-simplices of $K$. Elements
of $C_r(K)$ are called \emph{$r$-chains}.
\end{defn}

\begin{defn}[Boundary, chain complex]
The boundary operator $\partial_r$ on an oriented $r$-simplex
$\sigma_r$ is given by
$$
\partial_r \sigma_r
= \sum_{i = 0}^r (-1)^i(p_0 \cdots \hat{p}_i \cdots p_r),
$$
where $\hat{p}_i$ is taken to mean that vertex $i$ is omitted from the
$i$-th term. The \emph{chain complex} of $K$ is the sequence of
free abelian groups and homomorphisms
$$
0      \xrightarrow{i}
C_n(K) \xrightarrow{\partial_n}
\cdots
C_0(K) \xrightarrow{\partial_0}
0
$$
\end{defn}
