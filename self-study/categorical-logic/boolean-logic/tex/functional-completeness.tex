It is interesting to note that the ``material implication'' operator
$A \implies B \equiv \neg A \lor B$, combined with the nullary
operator ``false'' a.k.a. $0$ a.k.a. $\bot$, is functionally
complete, as can be seen by observing
$A \implies \bottom \equiv \neg A$ and
$$
A \implies \neg (A \implies B)
\equiv
\neg (A \land B).
$$
In the category of classical logical propositions these operators
correspond to the internal hom (exponential object) and the initial
object, respectively.

In general, a set of ``gates'' is functionally complete if
and only if it contains a gate that is not monotonic, affine,
self-dual, truth-preserving, or falsity-preserving. The
characterization of functional completeness of logical connectives is
given by Post's lattice.
