Homework and tests are stored in the private assignments/ submodule.
When cloning this repo, you should run

    git submodule update
    cd assignments/
    ./install.sh ..

to produce appropriate symlinks. After the semester ends you can run
the included `archive.sh` script on a particular symlink to move those
files into this (public) repository.
