\section{Differentiability of the Logarithm}

Let $U$ be an open set with $0 \notin U$.
Recall that $L(z)$ is called a branch of $\log z$ in $U$ if $L$
is continuous on $U$ and $e^{L(z)} = z$ for all $z \in U$. We will now
show that $L$ is holomorphic and $L^\prime = \frac{1}{z}$.

\begin{theorem}
Suppose $f$ is a primitive of $\frac{1}{z}$ in a domain $U$. Then
$\exists C \in \mathbb{C}$ such that $f + C$ is a branch of $\log z$ on $U$.
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
Let $g(z) = \frac{e^{f(z)}}{z}$. Then
$$
  g^\prime(z)
= \frac{e^{f(z)}f^\prime(z)}{z} - \frac{e^{f(z)}}{z^2}
= 0.
$$
Since $U$ is connected this means $g$ is constant, so
$g(z) = C_0$.

There exists $C \in mathbb{C}$ such that $e^C = \frac{1}{C_0}$. Then
$$
e^{f(z) + C} = \frac{e^{f(z)}}{C_0} = \frac{e^{f(z)}}{g(z)} = z,
$$
so $f + C$ is a branch of $\log z$ in $U$.
\end{proof}
