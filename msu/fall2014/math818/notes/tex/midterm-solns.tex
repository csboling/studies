\begin{Answer}
\begin{enumerate}[(a)]
  \item{
    We know $zg = gz$, $\forall g \in G$, so
    $$
    \varphi(z g) = \varphi(g z)
    $$
    and therefore
    $$
    \varphi(z)\varphi(g) = \varphi(g) \varphi(z)
    $$
    but since $\varphi$ is surjective then
    $\varphi(z)$ commutes with all elements of the group so
    $\varphi(z) \in Z(G)$.
  }
  \item{
    $\varphi$ can be conjugation, so $\varphi_a(H) = H$
    and then $a H a^{-1} = H$.
  }
  \item{
    For all $a \in G$ we have $\varphi_a(x) = a x a^{-1}$. Since $K$
    is normal in $G$ we have $a K a^{-1} = K$, so $\varphi_a$
    restricts to an automorphism of $K$. But $H$ is characteristic in
    $K$, so then $H \triangleleft G$.
  }
  \item{
    We can prove then $Z(K) \triangleleft G$ because we already showed
    that the center must be characteristic.
  }
\end{enumerate}

\begin{Problem}
\begin{enumerate}
  \item{
    Prove that $S_n$ is generated by $(12),(13),\cdots$.
  }
  \item{
  }
\end{enumerate}
\end{Problem}

\begin{Answer}
As suggested by the hint, we can generate any transposition $(ij)$ by
$(1i)(1j)(1i) = (ij)$. This is a special case of the conjugation
formula. Every element in the centralizer fixes the $(a_1 \cdots
a_k)$: this consists of disjoint cycles and powers of the cycle itself.
