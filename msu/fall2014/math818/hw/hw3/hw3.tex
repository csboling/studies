\begin{Problem}
Prove that a group of order 255 cannot be simple.
\end{Problem}

\begin{Answer}
Let $G$ be a group of order 255. The prime factorization of 255 is
$3 \cdot 5 \cdot 17$, so each Sylow subgroup of $G$ has prime
order. Therefore all Sylow subgroups of $G$ are disjoint except for
the identity.

The number of 17-Sylows must be congruent to 1 mod 17 and must divide
255. But the only factor of 255 congruent to 1 mod 17 is 1. Therefore
G has a unique 17-Sylow, and a unique $p$-Sylow must be normal. Since
this normal subgroup has order 17, it is a proper nontrivial normal
subgroup. Therefore $G$ cannot be simple.

\begin{Problem}
\begin{enumerate}[(a)]
  \item{
    Consider $\sigma = (13452)$ in $S_6$. Find the order of the
    centralizer $C_\sigma$ of $\sigma$ in $S_6$.
  }
  \item{
    How many elements of $S_7$ are conjugate to $a = (123)(45)$?
  }
\end{enumerate}
\end{Problem}

\begin{Answer}
To answer these questions we first find the size of the
conjugacy classes of a symmetric group.
We know that any permutation $\sigma$ can be written as a product of
disjoint cycles
$$
\sigma =
  (a_{11} a_{12} \cdots a_{1k_1})
  (a_{21} a_{22} \cdots a_{2k_2})
  \cdots
  (a_{m1} a_{m2} \cdots a_{mk_m})
$$
and furthermore from the conjugation formula that conjugation by a
permutation $\tau$ gives
\begin{align*}
\tau \sigma \tau^{-1} &=
  \tau
  (a_{11} a_{12} \cdots a_{1k_1})
  \cdots
  (a_{m1} a_{m2} \cdots a_{mk_m})
  \tau^{-1} \\
&=
  \tau
  (a_{11} a_{12} \cdots a_{1k_1})
  \tau^{-1}
  \cdots
  \tau
  (a_{m1} a_{m2} \cdots a_{mk_m})
  \tau^{-1} \\
&=
  (\tau(a_{11}) \tau(a_{12}) \cdots \tau(a_{1k_1}))
  \cdots
  (\tau(a_{m1}) \tau(a_{m2}) \cdots \tau(a_{mk_m})).
\end{align*}
Furthermore since $\tau$ is injective and since the $a_{ij}$ are
disjoint, so must $\tau(a_{ij})$ be.
Therefore any conjugate of a permutation $\sigma$ has a disjoint
cycle decomposition into cycles of the same lengths as those in the
decomposition of $\sigma$.

Next, take two permutations $\sigma$ and $\tau$ with the same cycle
structure
\begin{align*}
\sigma &=
  (a_{11} a_{12} \cdots a_{1k_1})
  (a_{21} a_{22} \cdots a_{2k_2})
  \cdots
  (a_{m1} a_{m2} \cdots a_{mk_m}), \\
\tau &=
  (b_{11} b_{12} \cdots b_{1k_1})
  (b_{21} b_{22} \cdots b_{2k_2})
  \cdots
  (b_{m1} b_{m2} \cdots b_{mk_m})
\end{align*}
and observe that with
$$
\omega =
  (a_{11} b_{11})
  (a_{12} b_{12})
  \cdots
  (a_{1k_1} b_{1k_1})
  \cdots
  (a_{m1} b_{m1})
  \cdots
  (a_{mk_m} b_{mk_m})
$$
we have $\omega \sigma \omega^{-1} = \tau$. Therefore any permutation
with the same cycle structure is conjugate to $\sigma$, so the
conjugacy classes in a symmetric group consist of exactly those
elements with the same cycle structure.

To enumerate the elements in a given conjugacy class in a symmetric
group we then list all elements with the same structure to their
disjoint cycle decompositions and eliminate repetitions. Ignoring the
separation into cycles, a disjoint cycle decomposition of an element
of $S_n$ can be thought of as an ordered list of $n$ elements, and
there are $n!$ such lists.

Take the disjoint decomposition of some element $a$.
Label the number of $i$-cycles in the decomposition by $r_i$.
 Since disjoint cycles commute, any two cycles in a decomposition
with the same length can be exchanged without affecting the
permutation. Therefore we can eliminate each rearrangement of
cycles of the same length, or divide out $\prod_{i} r_i!$ elements.
Furthermore a given $k$-cycle can be written in $k$ ways, as is seen
by rotating the notation to the left, e.g.
$(12) = (21)$, $(123) = (231) = (312)$. Therefore each of the
$r_k$ $k$-cycles in $\sigma$ admits $k$ representations, so we must
also divide by $\prod_i k^{r_k}$. This results in the formula
$$
\frac{n!}{\left(\prod_{i} r_i!\right) \left(\prod_i k^{r_k}\right)}
$$
for the number of elements in the conjugacy class of an arbitrary
permutation $\sigma$.

\begin{enumerate}[(a)]
  \item{
    The centralizer
    $$
    C_{S_6}(\sigma) =
    \{ \tau \in S_6
       \mid \sigma = \tau \sigma \tau^{-1}
    \}
    $$
    is the stabilizer of $\sigma$ under the group action
    $. : S_6 \times S_6 \to S_6$ given by conjugation. Therefore we have
    that $[S_6 : C_{S_6}(\sigma)] = |S_6 . \sigma|$, the order of the orbit of this
    action on $\sigma$. But this orbit is given by
    $$
    S_6 . \sigma =
    \{ \tau \sigma \tau^{-1} \mid \tau \in S_6 \}
    $$
    and by the conjugation formula
    $$
    \tau \sigma \tau^-1
    = \tau (13452) \tau^{-1}
    = (\tau(1) ~ \tau(3) ~ \tau(4) ~ \tau(5) ~ \tau(2))
    $$
    so elements of the form $\tau \sigma \tau^{-1}$ are exactly the
    5-cycles in $S_6$. of which there are $\frac{6!}{5^1 \cdot 1!}$. Then
    $$
    \frac{6!}{5} = [S_6 : C_{S_6}(\sigma)] = \frac{|S_6|}{|C_{S_6}(\sigma)|}
    $$
    so that
    $$
    |C_{S_6}(\sigma)| = \frac{|S_6|}{\frac{6!}{5}}
                     = \frac{6!}{\frac{6!}{5}}
                     = 5.
    $$
  }
  \item{
    The number of elements conjugate to $a$ is the order of the
    conjugacy class of $a$. Conjugacy classes in $S_n$ are in
    correspondence with the partitions of $n$, and in particular those

\begin{Problem}
Let $p$ and $q$ be distinct primes.
\begin{enumerate}[(a)]
  \item{
    Show that a group of order $p^2 q$ is solvable and that one of its
    Sylow subgroups is normal.
  }
  \item{
    Assume in addition that $p < q$ and $p$ does not divide $q -
    1$. Show that a group of order $p^2 q$ has to be abelian.
  }
\end{enumerate}
\end{Problem}

\begin{Answer}
\begin{enumerate}
  \item{
    Let $G$ be a group of order $|G| = p^2 q$.

    Let $P$ be an arbitrary $p$-Sylow of $G$ and let $Q$ be an
    arbitrary $q$-Sylow of $G$. Then $P \cap Q$ is a subgroup of $P$
    and a subgroup of $Q$, so $|P \cap Q|$ divides $|P| = p^2$ and
    $|P \cap Q|$ divides $|Q| = q$, and since $p$ and $q$ are distinct
    primes this is only possible when $|P \cap Q| = 1$. Therefore $P
    \cap Q$ is trivial.

    The number of $p$-Sylows $N_{p^2}$ must divide the order $p^2q$ of the
    group, so either $N_{p^2} \vert p^2$ or $N_{p^2} \vert q$. But
    we also must have $N_{p^2} \equiv 1 \mod p$, so it cannot be true
    that $N_{p^2} \vert p^2$ for in that case $N_{p^2} \equiv 0 \mod
    p$. Therefore either $N_{p^2} = 1$ or $N_{p^2} = q$.

    Suppose $N_{p^2} = q$. Then each of these $p$-Sylows has order
    $p^2$, so there are $q (p^2 - 1)$ non-identity elements belonging
    to the $p$-Sylows of $G$. Then there are
    $$
    |G| - (qp^2 - q) = qp^2 - (qp^2 - q) = q
    $$
    elements in the $q$-Sylows of $G$. But each $q$-Sylow has order
    $q$, so in this case there is a unique $q$-Sylow. Then there
    is either a unique $p$-Sylow or a unique $q$-Sylow which is
    therefore normal. Thus $G$ has a normal Sylow subgroup.
    Label this group $H$ and note that either $|H| = p^2$ or
    $|H| = q$.

    Consider $G / H$. If $|H| = p^2$ then $|G / H| = q$ is prime and
    so $G / H$ is cyclic and thus abelian. But $H$ is a $p$-group and
    therefore solvable, so it follows that $G$ is solvable.

    If $|H| = q$ then $|G / H| = p^2$. Then this is a $p$-group, so its
    center is nontrivial. Then since $|Z(G / H)|$ divides $p^2$ and is
    not 1, it must be $p^2$ (in which case $Z(G / H) = G / H$ and so
    $G / H$ is abelian) or else $p$. But if $|Z(G / H)| = p$ then
    $\left|\frac{G / H}{Z(G / H)}\right| = p$ and thus
    $\frac{G / H}{Z(G / H)}$ is cyclic, whence $G / H$ is abelian. But
    in this case $H$ is of prime order and thus cyclic, so we have an
    abelian tower $G \triangleright H \triangleright \{ 1 \}$.

\begin{Problem}
  \begin{enumerate}[(a)]

    \item{
      Show that $S_n$ is generated by $(12)$ and the $n$-cycle
      $(12 \cdots n)$.

      Show that if $n$ is a prime number, then $S_n$ is generated by

\begin{Answer}
\begin{enumerate}
  \item{
    Notice that
    $$
    (12)(23)(12) = (13).
    $$
    Furthermore suppose $(1 \to k - 1) \in H$. Then
    $$
    (1 \to k - 1)(k - 1 \to k)(1 \to k - 1) =
    (1k),
    $$
    so $(1k) \in H$ as well.
    Therefore $H$ contains every transposition $(1k)$ for
    $k \in \{ 2, \dots, n \}$, and we know that the transpositions
    $(12)$, $(13)$, \dots, $(1n)$ generate $H$.
  }
  \item{
    It is easier to see why the claim holds if we
    denote the letters of the symmetric group $S_n$ by $\{0, 1, \dots,
    n-1\}$. Then the conjugation
    $$
    (0 \to 1 \to \cdots \to n-1)
    (rs)
    (0 \to 1 \to \cdots \to n-1)^{-1} =
    (r + 1 \bmod n \to s + 1 \bmod n).
    $$
    If $r \equiv s \pm 1 \mod n$ then the orbit of this conjugation consists of
    all transpositions of the form $(i-1 \to i)$ for $i \in \{2, \dots,
    n\}$, i.e. the elements
    $(12)$, $(23)$, \dots, $(n-1 \to n)$, which from part (a)
    generate $S_n$.
  }
  \item{
    Let $n$ be a prime and denote the letters of the symmetric group
    by $\{0, 1, \dots, n - 1\}$ as in part (b). Again we note that
    conjugation of $(rs)$ by $(0 \to 1 \to \cdots \to n-1)$
    corresponds to adding 1 modulo $n$ to both $r$ and $s$.
    Without loss of generality let $r < s$, so that $s \neq 0$.
    Furthermore denote $\sigma = (0 \to 1 \to \cdots \to n - 1)$.

%    If $s = r \pm 1 \bmod n$ then this case is the same as part (b)
%    whether $n$ is prime or not. More generally, the orbit of $(rs)$
%    under this conjugation consists of all transpositions $(tq)$ with the
%    same spacing, i.e. all $(u \to v)$ such that $v - u = s - r$ and $(x
%    \to y)$ such that $y - x = r - s \bmod n$, where $u < v$,
%    $x < y$.

    Suppose $r$ is zero. Then since $n$ is prime, this means every
    element $m \in \mathbb{Z}_n$ has a multiplicative inverse, so
    considering $s$ as an integer mod $n$ there is an inverse $s^{-1}$ in
    $\mathbb{Z}_n$. Treating $(r, s)$ as a pair in $\mathbb{Z}_n^2$ we
    then see that
    \begin{align*}
    s^{-1} (r, s) &=
      \sum_{i=1}^{s^{-1}} (0, s) =
      \sum_{i=1}^{s^{-1} - 1} (0, s) + (0, s) =
      \sum_{i=1}^{s^{-1} - 1} s (0, 1) + (0, s) \\ &=
      (s^{-1} - 1)s (0, 1) + (0, s) = (0, 1),
    \end{align*}
    so conjugating $(rs) = (0s)$ by $\sigma$ a total of $(s^{-1} -
    1)s$ times yields $(01)$, and from part (a) we know that
    $(01)$, \sigma$ generates $S_n$.

    If $r \neq 0$ then we can first add $-r$ to get
    $(0 \to s - r \bmod n)$, and then since $r \neq s$ we have
    $s - r \bmod n \neq 0$ so $s - r$ has a multiplicative inverse $(s
    - r)^{-1}$. Therefore we can can conjugate $-r \bmod n$ times by
    $\sigma$ to get $(0, s-r)$, followed by $((s-r)^{-1} - 1)(s-r)$
    times to get $(0, 1)$. This completes the proof.

    How many abelian groups of order 3600 are there (up to isomorphism)?

  \item{
    Given an example of an abelian group which is both torsion and uncountable.

\end{Problem}

\begin{Answer}
\begin{enumerate}[(a)]
  \item{
    Let $A$ be an abelian group of order 3600.
    3600 has the prime factorization $2^4 \cdot 3^2 \cdot
    5^2$. Therefore
    $$
    A \simeq A[2^\infty] \times A[3^\infty] \times A[5^\infty]
    $$
    where
    $$
    |A[2^\infty]| = 2^4, \quad
    |A[3^\infty]| = 3^2, \quad
    |A[5^\infty]| = 5^2.
    $$
    $A[2^\infty] = A[2^4]$ has one of the following forms:
    $$
    \mathbb{Z}_{2^4}, \quad
    \mathbb{Z}_{2^3} \times \mathbb{Z}_{2}, \quad
    \mathbb{Z}_{2^2} \times \mathbb{Z}_{2}^2, \quad
    \mathbb{Z}_{2}^4
    $$
    $A[3^\infty] = A[3^2]$ has one of the following forms:
    $$
    \mathbb{Z}_{3^2}, \quad \mathbb{Z}_{3}^2
    $$
    $A[5^\infty] = A[5^2]$ has one of the following forms:
    $$
    \mathbb{Z}_{5^2}, \quad \mathbb{Z}_{5}^2.
    $$

    An abelian group consists of a combination of one option for
    $A[2^4]$, one option for $A[3^2]$, and one option for $A[5^2]$, e.g.
    $$
    \mathbb{Z}_{25} \times \mathbb{Z}_{16} \times \mathbb{Z}_{9},
    \quad
    \mathbb{Z}_{9} \times \mathbb{Z}_{8} \times \mathbb{Z}_5^2 \times \mathbb{Z}_2,
    $$
    et cetera. There are therefore $4 \cdot 2 \cdot 2 = 16$ such
    groups. Written in invariant factors, they are:
    \begin{align*}
      & \mathbb{Z}_{2}^{2} \times \mathbb{Z}_{30} \times \mathbb{Z}_{30} \\
      & \mathbb{Z}_{2}^{2} \times \mathbb{Z}_{6} \times \mathbb{Z}_{150} \\
      & \mathbb{Z}_{2}^{2} \times \mathbb{Z}_{10} \times \mathbb{Z}_{90} \\

      & \mathbb{Z}_{2} \times \mathbb{Z}_{10} \times \mathbb{Z}_{180}   \\
      & \mathbb{Z}_{2}^{2} \times \mathbb{Z}_{900}                      \\
      & \mathbb{Z}_{30} \times \mathbb{Z}_{120}                         \\

    $x + x = (x_i + x_i)_{i=1}^\infty = (0)_{i=1}^\infty$, so $A$ is torsion.
    But $A$ consists of all infinite sequences of binary digits, and
    therefore is in bijection with the interval $[0, 1)$ since these
    can be regarded as binary representations of the nonnegative real
    numbers with zero integer part.

        so $au + bv = 0$ and $cu + dv = 0$. But this means
        $adu + bdv = 0$ and $bcu + bdv = 0$, so subtracting these
        equations gives $(ad - bc)u = 0$, so since $ad - bc \neq 0$ it
        must be the case that $u = 0$. Similarly, we have
        $acu + bcv = 0$ and $acu + adv = 0$ so that $(ad - bc)v = 0$, so
        $v = 0$ as well. Therefore $(u, v) \in \ker(\varphi_A)$ implies
        $(u, v) = (0, 0)$ in this case, so the kernel is trivial and

        $\det(A) \det(B) = \det(I) = 1$, which means $\det(A)$ has a
        multiplicative inverse. Since $\det(A)$ is an integer this can
        only be true if $\det(A) = \pm 1$.

      \item{
        $\mu_n$ is a homomorphism for any $n \in \mathbb{Z}_+$

      \item{
        if $\det A > 0$ then $\mathrm{Im}(\varphi_A) = \ker(\psi_A)$, and

      \item{
        if $\det A < 0$ then $\mathrm{Im}(\varphi_A) = \ker(\psi_{(-A)})$.
      }
    \end{itemize}

    This is demonstrated below.
    \begin{itemize}
      \item{
        Let $n$ be a positive integer. We have
        \begin{align*}

          \mu_n
            \left(\begin{array}{c}
              x_1 + x_2 \\
              y_1 + y_2

          \left(\begin{array}{c}

        so $\mu_n$ is a homomorphism. Let $A \in
        \mathrm{GL}_2(\mathbb{Z})$. Then $\det A \neq 0$ and therefore
        $|\det A|$ is a positive integer, so
        $\psi_A = \mu_{|\det A|} \circ \varphi_{\hat{A}}$ is a
        composition of homomorphisms and thus a homomorphism itself.

        Suppose $\det A > 0$, and let $\alpha \in

        Suppose next
        $\alpha =

         so we have

         Similarly
         $$
         yab = xbc + (ad - bc)bv

         and

         $$
         Therefore $\alpha \in \mathrm{Im}(\varphi_A)$. We conclude
         that
         $\ker(\psi_{A}) = \mathrm{Im}(\varphi_A)$.

    Therefore when $\det A \neq 0$ there is a homomorphism
    $\psi : \mathbb{Z}^2 \to \mathbb{Z}_{|\det A|}^2$ such that

\begin{Problem}
By definition a \emph{lattice} in $\mathbb{R}^n$ is a subgroup $L$ of
$\mathbb{R}^n$ which contains a basis of the vector space
$\mathbb{R}^n$ and is discrete
$\mathbb{R}^n$ in the topology of $\mathbb{R}^n$.
\begin{enumerate}[(a)]
  \item{
    Assume $n = 1$. Show that a lattice $L$ in $\mathbb{R}$ is
    generated by a single real number $r$ and so
    $L = \{ n \cdot r \mid n \in \mathbb{Z} \}$. Conclude that, as an
    abstract group, $L$ is isomorphic to $\mathbb{Z}$.
  }
  \item{
    Assume $n = 2$. Show that every lattice $L$ in $\mathbb{R}^2$ is
    generated by a basis $\{f_1, f_2\}$ of $\mathbb{R}^2$. Conclude
    that every lattice $L$ in $\mathbb{R}^2$ is, as an abstract group,
    isomorphic to $\mathbb{Z}^2$.
  }
  \item{
    Extra credit: use induction to show that every lattice in
    $\mathbb{R}^n$ is isomorphic to $\mathbb{Z}^n$ as an abstract group.
  }
\end{enumerate}
\end{Problem}

\begin{Answer}
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item{
%     Let $B \subset \mathbb{R}$ be a basis for $\mathbb{R}$.
%     Suppose $\beta_1, \beta_2 \in B$ and $r \in \mathbb{R}$. Then
%     $$
%     r =
%       a_1 \beta 1 + a_2 \beta_2 =
%       a_1 \beta_1 + a_2 \frac{\beta_2}{\beta_1} \beta_1 =
%       \left(a_1 + a_2\frac{\beta_2}{\beta_1}\right)\beta_1,
%     $$
%     so $\{ \beta_1 \}$ spans $\mathbb{R}$. Furthermore we have
%     $$
%     a_1 \beta_1 + a_2 \beta_2 = 0 \iff a_1 = a_2 = 0
%     $$

      Let $L$ be a lattice in $\mathbb{R}$. Then $L$ contains a basis
      $\{ \beta \}$ of $\mathbb{R}$, where $\beta \in
      \mathbb{R}$. Since $L$ is a subgroup of $\mathbb{R}$ it must be
      closed under addition, and so $n \beta \in L$ for any $n \in \mathbb{Z}$.
      Therefore $\{ n \beta \mid n \in \mathbb{Z} \} \subset L$.

      Let $l \in L$. Then since $l \in \mathbb{R}$ and since
      $\{ \beta \}$ is a basis for $\mathbb{R}$, there is some
      $a \in \mathbb{R}$ such that $l = a \beta$.

      Use density of the rationals. By multiplying a rational $r / s$
      by $s$ we get an integer $r$. Since we can pick rationals
      arbitrarily close to $a \beta$ we should be able to take some
      $v = a \beta$ and demonstrate that there is some multiple that
      brings it closer than $\epsilon$ to another point $w$ in the lattice.

%Furthermore since
%      $L$ is a subgroup, $n l = n a \beta \in L$ for all $n \in
%      \mathbb{Z}$. Without loss of generality consider $l$ and
%      $l + a \beta$.

% Then for some $\varepsilon \in \mathbb{R}$ there
%      is a ball $B_{\varepsilon}(l) \subset \mathbb{R}$
