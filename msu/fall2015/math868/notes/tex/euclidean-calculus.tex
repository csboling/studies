\section{Euclidean space}

$n$-dimensional Euclidean space
$$
  \mathbb{R}^n
= \{ (x^1, x^2, \dots, x^n) : x^i \in \mathbb{R} \}
$$
is equipped with the \emph{Euclidean norm}
$$
\| x \| = \sqrt{ \sum_{i=1}^n (x^i)^2 }
$$
which induces a metric $d(x, y) = \| x - y \|$
and thus \emph{metric balls}
$$
  B(x, r)
= \Set{ y \in \mathbb{R}^n | d(x, y) < r }.
$$
These generate a topology where a set $U \subset \mathbb{R}^n$ is open
if $\forall u \in U$, $\exists \varepsilon > 0$ s.t.
$B(u, \varepsilon) \subset U$.

\begin{defn}[Neighborhood]
A \emph{neighborhood} of a point $x \in \mathbb{R}^n$ is an open set
$U \subset \mathbb{R}^n$ such that $x \in U$.
\end{defn}


\section{Regular functions}

\subsection{Classes of real functions}

\begin{defn}[Real function, differentiability classes]
A \emph{real function} is a function $f : U \to \mathbb{R}$ where
$U$ is open in $\mathbb{R}^n$.

Given $k \in \{ 0 \} \cup \mathbb{N} \cup \{ \infty \}$, $f$ is of
class $C^k$ at $p \in U$ provided that the partial derivatives
$\frac{\partial^j f}{\partial x^{i_1} \cdots \partial x^{i_j}}$ exist
and are continuous at $p$ for all $j \leq k$.
\end{defn}

Note that $f \in C^0$ at $p$ means $f$ is continuous at $p$. $f$ is
said to be $C^k$ on $U$ if this is true for all $p \in U$. Furthermore
$C^{k+1} \implies C^k$, $\forall k$. We also  denote
$$
  C^k(U)
= C^k(U, \mathbb{R})
= \Set{ f: U \to \mathbb{R} | f \in C^k }
$$
and say that $f$ is \emph{smooth} on $U$ if $f \in
\mathbb{C}^\infty(U)$.

\begin{xmpl}
For $f(x) = x^{1 / 3}$ we have $f \in C^1(\mathbb{R} \setminus \{ 0 \})$.
\end{xmpl}

\begin{theorem}[Fundamental theorem of calculus]
$$
g(x) = \int_0^x f(t) \dif t
$$
if and only if $g^\prime(x) = f(x)$. Here $g \in C^1(\mathbb{R})$ and
$g \in C^2(\mathbb{R} \setminus \{ 0 \})$, but
$g \notin C^2(\{ 0 \})$. This theorem allows us to construct for any
function in $C^k$ a function that is not in $C^{k+1}$, so these
classes are all distinct.
\end{theorem}

\subsection{Vector valued functions}
We say that a vector-valued function
$f \in C^k(U, \mathbb{R}^m)$ if each component function
$f^i = \pi_i \circ f$ is $C^k(U, \mathbb{R})$.

Given $f \in C^\infty(U, \mathbb{R})$ and $p \in U$,
$f$ has a Taylor series centered at $p = (p^1, \dots, p^n)$ given by
\begin{align*}
  f(x)
&= f(p) \\
&+ \sum_{i=1}^n
    \frac{\partial f}
         {\partial x^i}(p)
    (x^i - p^i) \\
&+ \frac{1}{2!}
    \sum_{i,j}
      \frac{\partial f}
           {\partial x^i \partial x^j}(p)
      (x^i - p^i)
      (x^j - p^j) \\
&+  \cdots \\
&+  \frac{1}{k!}
    \sum_{i_1, \cdots, i_k}
      \frac{\partial^k f}
           {\partial x^{i_1} \cdots \partial x^{i_k}}(p)
      \prod_{i_1, \cdots, i_k} (x^{i_j} - p^{i_j}) \\
&= f(p)
 + \mathrm{Jac}|_p(f) (x - p)
 + \frac{1}{2} \mathrm{Hess}|_p (x - p)(x - p)^T
 + \cdots
\end{align*}

\begin{defn}
A function $f \in C^\infty (U, \mathbb{R})$ is real-analytic at $p \in
U$ if $f(x)$ equals its Taylor series in some neighborhood of $p$.
In this case we write $f \in C^\omega(U, \mathbb{R})$.
\end{defn}

\begin{xmpl}
A function that is smooth but not real-analytic is the bump function
$$
  f(x)
= \left\{
    \begin{array}{l l}
      0             & x \leq 0, \\
      e^{-\frac{1}{x}} & x > 0
    \end{array}
  \right.
$$
This function's Taylor series at 0 is constant 0, but it is not equal
to 0 on any neighborhood of 0.
\end{xmpl}

\begin{defn}[Star-shaped set]
A set $U \subset \mathbb{R}^n$ is said to be \emph{star-shaped} with
respect to a point $p \in U$ if for each point $u \in U$ the line
segment $[u, p] \subset U$. $U$ is convex if it is star-shaped with
respect to every point in $U$.
\end{defn}

In particular note that a metric ball is convex.

\begin{theorem}[Taylor series with remainder]
Let $U \subset \mathbb{R}^n$ be star-shaped with respect to some $p$
and let $f \in C^\infty(U, \mathbb{R})$. Then there exist smooth
functions $g_i \in C^\infty(U, \mathbb{R})$, $i = 1, \dots, n$ such
that
\begin{enumerate}
  \item{
    $$
    f(x) = f(p) + \sum_{i=1}^n g_i(x) (x^i - p^i)
    $$
  }
  \item{
    $$
    g_i(p) = \frac{\partial f}{\partial x^i} (p).
    $$
  }
\end{enumerate}
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
Let $x \in U$. Restrict $f$ to the line segment $[p, x]$,
i.e. $\gamma(t) = p + t(x - p)$, $t \in [0, 1]$. Then
$$
  \frac{\dif}{\dif t} (f \circ \gamma) (t)
= \nabla f (p + t(x - p)) \cdot (x - p)
= \sum_{i=1}^n
    \frac{\partial f}
         {\partial x^i}
    (p + t(x - p))
    \cdot
    (x^i - p^i).
$$
Let
$$
  g_i(x)
= \int_0^1
    \frac{\partial f}
         {\partial x^i}
    (p + t(x - p))
    \dif t
$$
and note that since $f \in C^\infty$ so is $g_i$, and
$g_i(p) = \frac{\partial f}{\partial x^i}(p)$. But
\begin{align*}
   f(x) - f(p)
&= \int_0^1
    \frac{\dif}{\dif t}
      f(p + t(x - p)) \\
&= \int_0^1
     \sum_{i=1}^n
       \frac{\partial f}
            {\partial x^i}
       (p + t(x - p))
       \cdot
       (x^i - p^i) \\
&= \sum_{i=1}^n
     g_i(x) (x^i - p^i).
\end{align*}
as desired.
\end{proof}

Take $p = 0$. Then
\begin{align*}
   f(x)
&= f(0) + g_1(x) \cdot x \\
&= f(0) + [g_1(0) + g_2(x) \cdot x] x \\
&= f(0) + g_1(0) x + g_2(x) x^2 \\
&= f(0) + g_1(0) x + [g_2(0) + g_3(x) x] x \\
&= f(0)
 + g_1(0) x
 + g_2(0) x^2
 + \cdots
 + g_i(0) x^i
 + g_{i+1}(0) x^{i+1}
 + \cdots
\end{align*}

\section{Tangent vectors and derivations}

This is a discussion of tangent vectors in Euclidean space, but will
later be generalized to discuss tangent spaces $T_p M$ to a manifold
$M$ at a point $p$.

Let $v \in \mathbb{R}^n$, given by $v = (v^1, \dots, v^n)$. We can
also regard this point as a vector, and we may draw the distinction
with the notation $\langle v^1, \dots, v^n \rangle$. We might instead
consider vectors based at some point $p$ other than the origin.

We write $T_p(\mathbb{R}^n) = T_p \mathbb{R}^n$ to mean the space of
all vectors in $\mathbb{R}^n$ based at a point $p \in
\mathbb{R}^n$. This is a $\mathbb{R}$-vector space, with a vector
space isomorphism $T_p \mathbb{R}^n \simeq \mathbb{R}^n$.

\subsection{Tangent vectors}

\begin{defn}[Directional derivative]
Consider a neighborhood $U$ of $p$, and let $f \in
C^\infty(U, \mathbb{R})$. Consider the one-parameter family of points
$c: \mathbb{R} \to U$ given by
$$
  c(t)
= (p^1 + tv^1, \dots, p^n + t v^n)
$$
so that $c(0) = p$, $c^\prime(0) = v$. Then we define the
\emph{directional derivative} of $f$ at $p$ in direction $v$ by
$$
  D_v f
= \left.
    \frac{\dif}{\dif t}
  \right|_{t = 0}
    f(c(t)).
$$
This is a real number measuring the rate of change of $f$ in direction
$v$.
\end{defn}

Recall that
$$
  \mathrm{grad}(f)(p)
= \nabla f(p)
= \left\langle
    \frac{\partial f}
         {\partial x^1}(p),
    \dots,
    \frac{\partial f}
         {\partial x^n}(p)
  \right\rangle
$$
and that the chain rule says that
$$
  D_v f
= \nabla f(p) \cdot v
= \sum_{i=1}^n
    v^i
    \frac{\partial f}
         {\partial x^i}(p).
$$
We can therefore consider
$D_v : C^\infty(U) \to \mathbb{R}$
given by $g \mapsto D_v g$, i.e. we define the operator
$$
  D_v
= \sum_{i=1}^n
    v^i
    \left.
      \frac{\partial}
           {\partial x^i}
    \right|_p.
$$

Note that $C^\infty(U)$ is a $\mathbb{R}$-vector space, and indeed a
$\mathbb{R}$-algebra since we have multiplication of $C^\infty$
functions (given by $(f \cdot g)(x) = f(x) \cdot g(x)$) in a way that respects the vector space
structure. Furthermore, $D_v$ is a linear map. We would therefore like
to make an identification between $v \in T_p \mathbb{R}^n$ with the
operators $D_v$. However, $v$ depends only on the point $p$, while
$C^\infty(U)$ depends on the choice of open set $U$ containing $p$.

\subsection{Germs of smooth functions}

\begin{defn}[Germs]
Consider the set of all pairs
$$
  \mathcal{X}_p
= \Set{ (f, U)
  |     U \text{ is a neighborhood of } p,
        f \in C^\infty (U)
  }
$$
and define a relation on $\mathcal{X}_p$ by
$(f_1, U_1) \sim (f_2, U_2)$ if there exists a neighborhood $U$ of $p$
with $U \subset U_1 \cap U_2$ and $f_1 = f_2$ on $U$. Note that if
$(f_1, U_1) \sim (f_2, U_2)$ then $D_v f_1 = D_v f_2$ for any
$v \in T_p \mathbb{R}^n$, since the derivatives agree on the whole
neighborhood. The \emph{germs of smooth functions at $p$} are the
equivalence classes of $C^\infty(U)$ under this relation, and this
quotient space is denoted $C_p^\infty$.
\end{defn}

It will be shown in homework problems that $C_p^\infty$ is also a
$\mathbb{R}$-vector space, and even a
$\mathbb{R}$-algebra. Furthermore $D_v : C_p^\infty \to \mathbb{R}$ is
linear, though it is not an algebra homomorphism since it operates on
the product of functions by the Leibniz rule
$$
  D_v (f \cdot g)
= D_v (f) \cdot g(p)
+ f(p) \cdot D_v (g),
$$
which is true because
$  D_v
 = \sum_{i=1}^n
     v^i
     \left.
       \frac{\partial}{\partial x^i}
     \right|_p
$ and these partial derivatives satisfy the Leibniz rule.

\begin{defn}[Derivation]
A \emph{point derivation} at $p$ is a linear map
$D : C_p^\infty \to \mathbb{R}$ that satisfies the Leibniz rule
$$
D (f \cdot g) = D(f) \cdot g(p) + f(p) \cdot D(g),
$$
\end{defn}

In the homework it will be shown that the space of point derivations
at $p$, written $\mathcal{D}_p(\mathbb{R}^n)$, is a
$\mathbb{R}$-vector space. There is a function
$\phi: T_p \mathbb{R}^n \to \mathcal{D}_p \mathbb{R}^n$ given by
$$
        v
      = \langle v^1, \dots, v^n \rangle
\mapsto D_v
      = \sum_{i=1}^n
          v^i
          \left. \frac{\partial}{\partial x^i}\right|_p.
$$
In particular the basis vectors
$e_i = \langle 0, 0, \dots, 1, \dots, 0 \rangle$ are mapped to
$D_{e_i} = \left.\frac{\partial}{\partial x^i}\right|_p$. We will
write
$$
  \delta^i_j
= \left\{
    \begin{array}{l c}
      1, & \quad i = j \\
      0, & \quad i \neq j
    \end{array}
  \right.
$$

\begin{theorem}
$\phi : T_p \mathbb{R}^n \to \mathcal{D}_p \mathbb{R}^n \subset
(C_p^\infty \to \mathbb{R})$ given by
$v \mapsto D_v$ or explicitly
$$
  v
= \sum_{i=1}^n v^i e_i
\mapsto
  \sum_{i=1}^n v^i \left.\frac{\partial}{\partial x^i}\right|_p
$$
 is an isomorphism of $\mathbb{R}$-vector spaces.
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}

\begin{itemize}
  \item{
    $\phi$ is injective. Clearly the map is linear.
    Denote the $i$-th coordinate function
    $x^i : \mathbb{R}^n \to \mathbb{R}$, given by $p \to p^i$, and note
    that
    $\left.\frac{\partial}{\partial x^j}\right|_p (x^i) = \delta_i^j$.
    Suppose $\phi(v) = D_v = 0$ for some $v \in T_p \mathbb{R}^n$. Then
    $$
      0
    = D_v (x^j)
    = \sum_{i=1}^n
        v^i
        \left.
          \frac{\partial}
               {\partial x^j}
        \right|_p
          (x^j)
    = v^j,
    $$
    so $\ker \phi = \{ 0 \}$.
  }
  \item{
    $\phi$ is surjective.

    \begin{lemma}
      Let $D$ be a point derivation of $C_p^\infty$. Then $D(c) = 0$ for all constant
      functions.
    \end{lemma}
    \begin{proof}
      \begin{align*}
           D(c)
        &= D(c \cdot 1)
         = c D(1)
         = c D(1 \cdot 1) \\
        &= c (1 D(1) + 1 D(1))
         = 2 c D(1)
         = 2 D(c)
      \end{align*}
      so $D(c) = 0$.
    \end{proof}

    Let $D \in \mathcal{D}_p \mathbb{R}^n$, $v^i = D(x^i)$, and let
    $[f] \in C_p^\infty$. Choose some representative
    $f : U \to \mathbb{R}$ of this equivalence class, taking $U$ to be
    as small as we like. In particular since the domain is open, we
    may take $U$ to be some small ball which is thus star-shaped, so
    we may use Taylor's theorem with remainder to write
    $$
      f(x)
    = f(p)
    + \sum_{i=1}^n
        g_i(x)
        (x^i - p^i), \quad
      g_i(p)
    = \frac{\partial f}{\partial x^i}(p).
    $$
    Then
    \begin{align*}
       D f
    &= D(f(p))
     + D(\sum g_i (x) (x^i - p^i) \\
    &= \sum
         \left(
           g_i(p) D(x^i - p^i)
         + D(g_i(x))(p^i - p^i)
         \right) \\
    &= \sum
         g_i(p) D(x^i) \\
    &= \sum_{i=1}^n
         D(x^i)
         \frac{\partial f}
              {\partial x^i}(p) \\
    &= \sum_{i=1}^n
         v^i
         \frac{\partial f}
              {\partial x^i}(p) \\
    &= D_v f
    \end{align*}
    so $D = D_v = \phi(v)$ for some $v$.
  }
\end{itemize}
\end{proof}

\begin{defn}[Vector field]
A \emph{vector field} on a neighborhood $U \subset \mathbb{R}^n$ is a
map $X$ that associates to each $p \in U$ a vector
$X_p \in \mathcal{D}_p \mathbb{R}^n$. We can write a vector field in
coordinates as
$$
X = \sum_{i=1}^n v^i \frac{\partial}{\partial x^i}
$$
where $v^i : U \to \mathbb{R}$. We say that a vector field is smooth
if each of its component functions $v^i$ is smooth.
\end{defn}

Vectors at a point act as point derivations whereas vector fields act
as derivations, i.e. $X$ is a derivation of $C^\infty(U)$,
or $X: C^\infty(U) \to C^\infty(U)$. At each point $p$ we have
$$
(X f)(p) = X(f)(p)= X_p f,
$$
and since each vector $X_p$ is a point derivation, $X$ as a map
satisfies the Leibniz rule
$$
X (f \cdot g) = f \cdot X(g) + X(f) \cdot g.
$$
Therefore vector fields on $U$ are \emph{derivations} of the algebra of
functions $C^\infty(U) \to C^\infty(U)$, as opposed to tangent vectors $X_p$ which are
\emph{point derivations} of the algebra $C_p^\infty$ of germs at a
point $p$.

\begin{xmpl}
In $\mathbb{R}^2$, with $(x^1, x^2) = (x, y)$ we have a vector field
$$
X = x^2 \frac{\partial}{\partial x} - e^{xy} \frac{\partial}{\partial y}.
$$
For $f(x, y) = xy$ we have
$$
(Xf)(x, y) = x^2 y - e^{xy} x.
$$
\end{xmpl}

We can compose vector fields $X$, $Y$ by composing maps, but typically
the composition is no longer a derivation. However $XY - YX$ is a
derivation, known as the \emph{Lie bracket} $[X, Y]$ of vector fields.
