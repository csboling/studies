\begin{defn}[Open relation]
An equivalence relation $\sim$ is said to be \emph{open} when the
canonical surjection $\pi: X \to X / \sim$ is open, i.e.
$\pi^{-1}(\pi(U)) = \cup_{u \in U} [u]$ is open.
\end{defn}

\begin{prop}
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item{
      Quotients by open relations preserve second countability.
    }
    \item{
    }
  \end{enumerate}
\end{prop}

\begin{defn}
The \emph{graph} of a relation $\sim$ is
$$
  \Gamma_\sim
= \{ (s_1, s_2) \vert s_1 \sim s_2 \}
\subset S \times S,
$$
(i.e. the pullback of $\pi$ along $\pi$).
\end{defn}
